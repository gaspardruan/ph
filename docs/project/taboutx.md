## Key Bindings Conflict

TaboutX has the lowest priority, so if you have other extensions that use the `Tab` or `Shift+Tab` key bindings,
you may need to change their key bindings to avoid conflicts. How to configure key bindings in VS Code:

1. Go to File > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts (or press `Ctrl+K Ctrl+S`).
2. Search "taboutx" or "taboutxBack".
3. Right-click on the command and select "Change Keybinding".
4. Press the new key combination you want to use and click "OK".

But in the end, you will find that `Tab` is still the best key binding for this extension.
